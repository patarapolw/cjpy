Start with a batch of 20. Will make a new batch if the previous has been surpassed.

After every rounds of not-Right's, there will be unlimited repeat drills until you get everything Right.

No typo checking. However, there is a middle-way button, "Not Sure".

`ESC` for Not Sure / Skip. `F1` or `F5` to end session and start the repeat drill or a new session.

Mulitple answers if applicable, separated by `;`.
